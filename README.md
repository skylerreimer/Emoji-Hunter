# Emoji-Hunter
We made this application during Hack Ohio 2016 as a way to learn how to make Android apps.
The goal of the game is to select the correct emoji as shown in the screenshot.
You get points and time for being correct and lose time for being incorrect

# Note

This application is mostly a proof of concept. We wanted to learn at this hackathon and did not intend to win anything. Thus, this is not a complete product nor should it be viewed as one. We plan to revisit it sometime this coming winter. Please contact any of us with questions if they come up. Thanks for visiting!
